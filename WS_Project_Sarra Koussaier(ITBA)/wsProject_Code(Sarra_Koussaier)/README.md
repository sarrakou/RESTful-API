# WebServProject
#My final Project for the IT325 Web Services course this semester consists of a RESTful API developed using Node.js, Express, JWT, HTML, EJS, and CSS. The resources were #stored thanks
#to the implementation of PostgreSQL and ElephantSQL.
#I have also used technologies such as Heroku, NGINX, Postman, VSCode, and Git-Version
#Control to maximize the project’s quality.
#This project contains all the CRUD Operations, secured with JWT token authentication, SSL
#Certificates (by Heroku), and SSH Keys. Multiple Postman Snippets were also used in order to
#test this project’s efficiency.
#This projects aim is to facilitate the information sharing of the Tunisian public bus transportation data in a secure manner.
#Its main function is returning a desired bus station name to someone who wishes to travel from
#one station to the other and is clueless about the Tunisian public bus transportation system.
